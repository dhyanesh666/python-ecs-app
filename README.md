Successfully deployed a Python application on AWS ECS with complete automation.
Used GitHub Actions for CI/CD and Terraform for infrastructure as code.
With every push to the main branch, the Docker image is built and pushed to ECR.
With a single click, the entire AWS infrastructure is provisioned, including an Application Load Balancer for public access.

Proud of this end-to-end automation setup.
